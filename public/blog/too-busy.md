People are busy, and I'm no exception. Between college courses for my major and minor, sports, reading, club involvement, and my startup, it can be really difficult to find time for myself in a day. This doesn't even take into consideration social obligations with friends and family. There's almost no time to sleep or practice self-care.

Lately, I've been feeling that people pile far too much on their plates, leaving themselves unable to tend to everything. This has especially come up with my involvement with the Sports Analytics Society.

I reached out to this organization last semester asking about their more advanced software/ML projects. They responded that they had considered doing things of this nature, but catered more towards the casual beginner sports fan. I put forth the proposition to start a more advanced project. Some of my friends were interested, and some of their current members were interested as well. Unfortunately, people got busy and it fizzled out really quickly.

This semester was different. I set up a schedule, we made a flyer, attended quad day, and everything was golden. I had to sift through over 70 applications, narrowing down to a team of 12 developers. Admittedly, this process has given me loads of respect for recruiters at companies, especially during the fall hiring surge. It is endlessly tiring being in communication with so many people who want something from you and are. trying to mask it, but that's a topic for a different post.

Once I had my team set up, it was time to get to work! Actual work. Work that involved working. Work that involved taking some of your time and dedicating it to the thing you committed to. You see, when I was interviewing people, I didn't focus on people who had loads of experience and practice with coding, machine learning, or any of that. I did my best to sort through and find the most passionate candidates. The ones who reached out to me separately to let me know that they were super excited for this opportunity. They were making my job as 'recruiter' so much easier. In fact, everybody I interviewed, I asked if they had 5-7 hours each week to commit to this project. They all said they could swing it, they had little to no other involvement, and they had easy classes. But all of a sudden, it's time to work.

And they're too busy. Not responding to chats in Teams. Not showing up to meetings. Even dropping out after signaling to me that they were overwhelmingly interested in participating. Waiting until I sent out an email rejecting over 50 other qualified applicants. And now they are too busy.

It's not just in this club either. It's in group projects for class. It's evident in the way that people interact these days that everybody is 'too busy.' But what does that really mean?

Now that my 500-word backstory is complete, it's time for the main point I'm trying to make. You aren't 'too busy.' You just can't prioritize correctly. I'll be the first to admit that this is still something I'm learning as a sorta-new 20 year old. But learning to prioritize the things in your life is so powerful. You can't just stumble through your days, doing whatever seems important in that moment. You need to contribute to the bigger picture. 

When people tell me that they are too busy and can't make a meeting for some reason or another, I hear that they are choosing the benefits (or lack of consequences) of some other activity rather than my meeting. In many instances, that is fair. Someone has a shift because they need to make money. Someone has a family obligation. But those add up, and eventually your trust in that person begins to deteriorate. You realize you can't count on them for simple tasks because they genuinely prioritize other things. When push comes to shove, they are going to choose just about everything else. 

I think ultimately, that is the toughest part about working on a team at such a prestigious college with so many brilliant individuals. This is everybody's first taste of having so much freedom, and everybody needs to do everything they can in order to stand out to employers. But eventually, you have too much going on that you can't fully give your heart to anything. That's when the quality of your work suffers. You start to use AI to get things done. Anything that doesn't have a due date stamped on it just isn't happening. We are all spread so thin in order to try to stand out that we can't actually make progress. I don't think I even realized how many things I was juggling until I sat down to write this.

But this October, I've made a pact to myself. I need to get my priorities in order. I don't know exactly what that order is, but I'm really excited to find out. My first one is my physical/mental health. I've been pushing myself to write/create more. My journal and now this website are all great outlets. I think I want to try YouTube as well. This allows me to get in touch with myself, as opposed to the constant inflow of information I'm used to receiving. as for my physical health, sleep and sport have been top of mind lately. I played full court pickup basketball yesterday for the first time in months, and I felt great afterwards. My new bedtime is 11pm and wake up is before 7:30am. This ensures I'm getting quality sleep and not wasting the day away. My book list is also ever growing, and I think I'm gonna do a write-up about some of my favorites tomorrow.

Anyways, I know this sucks. I don't even think people will be able to find it. But I'm sure I'll get better at it with more practice. In the meantime, just stay tuned I guess! I have a whole list of posts I want to make, so this should be the first of many.
